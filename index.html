                        <p>
                          An Affiliate Program is where a user of a product
                          receives commission for promoting that product to
                          their audience. Therefore, an Alison Affiliate is a
                          learner who earns money for promoting Alison courses
                          and tools.

                          2. Go to any page on the Alison website that you would
                          like to share with your audience, whether that is a
                          specific

                          No, as per the Affiliate Programme T&amp;Cs, an Alison
                          Affiliate agrees to be fair and honest. They agree not
                          to use cookie stuffing or click generators to
                          artificially create traffic leads by robot software.
                          No payments will be made to any Affiliate who
                          generates advertising revenue using unfair means.
